# Wordle-Probability-Algorithm
## A extension of the Worlde-App using TDD Approach and following Clean Code Standard ##

### Intro :
<ul>
<li> As a software professional, I faced a challenge while working on the Wordle App. I needed to implement a probability factor that could estimate the likelihood of a player guessing the correct word within a given number of attempts.

<li> Initially, I attempted to integrate existing algorithms found on the internet into my codebase, but none of them were suitable for my specific use case. Consequently, I decided to develop my own algorithm.

<li> To achieve this, I researched the guessing behavior of the original Wordle App by New York Times (link: https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). Although the original algorithm was complex and required more time, I was able to develop a basic version that met the requirements of my project.

<li> In conclusion, I was able to leverage my skills as a software professional to develop a unique solution to the challenge presented by the Wordle App. By taking inspiration from existing work and adapting it to my specific use case, I was able to create an algorithm that met the project's requirements.

### QUESTION / PROBLEM : 
<code>

$ Find the probability of guessing the right 5 letter word for the following conditions: 
1) Total number of words is 14855 (Sample Size)
2) Total number of attempts is 6 
3)  One word per attempt (x)
>> Find p(n) for each attempt.

Note : If 'x' word contains a character or more (but not all) of the right 5  letter word in any attempt what is the probability factor in the next attempt?
</code>

### NOTES :

I faced a challenge that required me to think outside the box. I consulted with my friends and colleagues for ideas on how to proceed.

After three days of deliberation, I decided to take the initiative and tackle the challenge myself. With a determination to succeed, I set out to explore all possible solutions and unearth the hidden treasure.

Through my efforts and persistence, I was able to develop a unique and effective solution to the challenge presented to me. In conclusion, my experience highlights the importance of self-motivation and perseverance in the face of challenging obstacles in the software development field.
